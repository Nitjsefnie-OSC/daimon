"""May the agent post anything at all where this turn would answer?

`admit()` refuses a turn whose reply would land in a write-protected channel,
but adapters post notices of their own around admission: setup, capacity,
role lookup, refusals, rendered errors. So each turn entry computes a
`ProtectionState` FIRST -- before tenant liveness, provisioning or any other
read that can fail -- and every adapter post in that turn's prologue, denial
and error paths goes through one may-post check: only `UNPROTECTED` posts.
`PROTECTED` and `UNKNOWN` log instead.

Computing the state never raises. Any failure -- a policy that doesn't parse,
the database or pool, the category lookup's platform call -- yields `UNKNOWN`,
because a channel whose safety can't be established gets nothing, not even an
error.
